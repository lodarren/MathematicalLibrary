# Mathematics Library

## CPSC210 WT2 Project Darren Lo 93930725

For most students, researching mathematical formulas and theorems is something one must do during their time at school. 
However, when looking up a simple formula, very often one would find themselves bombarded with information that isn't 
useful for their specific purpose, or obtain too much information for their usage. The goal of this project is to create
a mathematical library that allows the user to quickly and easily find a mathematical resource they need, and easily
obtain more information (such as its specific proof, some example problems, analogies to remember it etc.) tailored to 
their needs in an intuitive way. 

Some example features of the program include:
- The ability to look up a list of theorems in alphabetical order
- To interact with the UI to obtain more infomration about the formula (ex. proofs, practice problems etc. )
  (not all information will be shown at once in order to make things more concise and easy to read)
- The ability to allow the user to contribute to the database by adding their own explainations and theorems
- A request list for theorems/formulas that have not been convered yet
- The ability to move a draft theorem entry into the main page

This project is aimed towards anyone who is interested in studying mathematics, and will attempt to be made in a way
to be as user friendly as possible. 


**User Stories**
- As a user, I want to be able to look up mathematical theorem entries in order
- As a user, I want to be able to look up a theorem that matches the name I am looking for
- As a user, I want to be able to access additional information about the theories, and hide those that are not 
important to me
- As a user, I want to be able to suggest requests for entires to be added (in categories theorem, questions, proofs etc.)
 and have them be viewable for other users to contribute.
- As a user, I want to be able to contribute to the database by browsing through the cateogry I want to contribute to, 
and have it become posted onto the main list of mathematical entries.
