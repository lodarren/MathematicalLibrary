# Mathematics Library

For most students, researching mathematical formulas and theorems is something one must do during their time at school. 
However, when simply keeping track of formulas and theorems, one would typically find it very hard to keep track of all 
the different ideas to remember, and is not efficient to studying. The goal of this project is to create a mathematical 
library that allows the user to quickly and easily find a mathematical resource they need, and easily
obtain more information (such as its specific proof, some example problems etc.) tailored to their needs in an 
intuitive way.

The library will be separated into three different types of sections, equations (for math equations), theorems (concepts
to remember) and finally requests (one of the previous two entries that have not been implemented in the main library
yet.). Users will be able to navigate through these menus and view, modify and add the entries that are in those 
libraries. 

This project is aimed towards anyone who is interested in studying mathematics, and will attempt to be made in a way
to be as user-friendly as possible.
