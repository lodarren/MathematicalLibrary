# Mathematics Library

## CPSC210 WT2 Project Darren Lo 93930725

For most students, researching mathematical formulas and theorems is something one must do during their time at school. 
However, when looking up a simple formula, very often one would find themselves bombarded with information that isn't 
useful for their specific purpose, or obtain too much information for their usage. The goal of this project is to create
a mathematical library that allows the user to quickly and easily find a mathematical resource they need, and easily
obtain more information (such as its specific proof, some example problems, analogies to remember it etc.) tailored to 
their needs in an intuitive way. 

This project is aimed towards anyone who is interested in studying mathematics, and will attempt to be made in a way
to be as user friendly as possible. 


**User Stories**
- As a user, I want to be able to look up a theorem that matches the name I am looking for. 
- As a user, I want to be able to access additional information about the theories, and view the proof when I need to
to view it. 
- As a user, I want to be able to view equations that are in the library, and view the corresponding practice problems 
for them. 
- As a user, I want to view a practice problem while hiding the answer, and then show the answer to the practice problem 
when I am ready. 
- As a user, I want to be able to suggest requests for entires to be added (in categories theorem, questions, proofs 
etc.) and have them be viewable for other users to contribute.
- As a user, I want to be able to contribute to the database by browsing through the cateogry I want to contribute to, 
and have it become posted onto the main list of mathematical equations or the main list of mathematical theorems.
