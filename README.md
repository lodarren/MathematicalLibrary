# Mathematics Library

## CPSC210 WT2 Project Darren Lo 93930725

For most students, researching mathematical formulas and theorems is something one must do during their time at school. 
However, when simply keeping track of formulas and theorems, one would typically find it very hard to keep track of all 
the different ideas to remember, and is not efficient to studying. The goal of this project is to create a mathematical 
library that allows the user to quickly and easily find a mathematical resource they need, and easily
obtain more information (such as its specific proof, some example problems etc.) tailored to their needs in an 
intuitive way.

The library will be separated into three different types of sections, equations (for math equations), theorems (concepts
to remember) and finally requests (one of the previous two entries that have not been implemented in the main library
yet.). Users will be able to navigate through these menus and view, modify and add the entries that are in those 
libraries. 

This project is aimed towards anyone who is interested in studying mathematics, and will attempt to be made in a way
to be as user-friendly as possible. 

**User Stories**
- As a user, I want to be able to look up a theorem that matches the name I am looking for. 
- As a user, I want to be able to access additional information about the theories, and view the proof when I need to
 view it. 
- As a user, I want to be able to view equations that are in the library, and view the corresponding practice problems 
for them. 
- As a user, I want to view a practice problem while hiding the answer, and then show the answer to the practice problem 
when I am ready. 
- As a user, I want to be able to suggest requests for entries to be added and add the fields I would like to add at the
moment. 
- As a user, I want to be able to contribute to the database adding a request to one of the main lists of equation 
entries or to the main list of theorems depending on the request that is being submitted. 
- As a user, I want to be able to save my to-do list to file. 
- A a user, I want to be prompted to save my request entries, my equation entries and my theorem entries when I attempt
to quit the program.
